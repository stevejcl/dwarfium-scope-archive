  ```

Install the necessary Python libraries on windows:

  ```bash
pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
  ```

Currently Supported Devices: USB, FTP, and MTP but only to Archive the files.

## Chapter 3: Usage

## Chapter 4: Features

### Home Page:

On this page, you will see a slideshow of your favorite images, which you have marked on the Explore Page.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d4f60fe-27a2-462e-a834-7c98972c011a)

### Dwarf Configuration Page:

Configure your Dwarf device by adding a name, a description, and the USB path when it's plugged into your computer. You can also provide the IP address in STA Mode to connect with FTP.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58704632-0e47-4f06-ba20-37278b679dbe)

For Dwarf 2, it will be detected on your computer through MTP. This will allow you to scan its drive and later add sessions to your backup drive.

Two action buttons allow you to:

Launch a scan of the Dwarf drive.

Launch the Explore path to view what's currently on your Dwarf, including:

Image previews.

Session details (exposure, gain, number of images).

Whether the session is backed up or not.

You can then directly bacedup with the Backup button

### Backup Page:

Configure your Backup Drive by adding a name, description, and the main path of the backup drive. Specify a subdirectory within the backup drive where you want to store your Dwarf sessions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c73c433-e4fb-40d2-887e-bb748ebe40ef)

A backup drive is associated with a Dwarf device.

You can create multiple levels of directories. For example, you could create a sublevel with object names, and under each object, store its sessions. This way, all your sessions will be organized by object name (directory name) instead of the target present in the session.

A catalog is now included, Go to the Catalog page to manage your object list, allowing you to change the object of a session.

Additionally, there will be a section to add Darks sessions, which you can associate with your sessions for processing.

### Explore Page:
This is the main view where you can see your sessions, organized by object, backup, or Dwarf.

![explore](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5209aa7-4029-4059-b932-233d6bd196cc)

You will be able to:

View images (JPG, PNG, or even FITS).

Add images to your favorites.

Open images in full screen.

Open the image's directory.

You will also have access to all the session details, such as the number of images, exposure, gain, and more.
You'll also know if the session is stored on your Dwarf or not.

If you have taken a Mosaic you will have access to the different panels.

![mosaic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e83d8a8-8a1a-432d-85f0-2f13997d1159)

![pannels](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ee96ed0-018f-41bd-898c-803b9afcea91)


### Catalog Page
In this page, you can associate a target detecting during the scan process to an object of the build in DSO Catalog from Dwarfium

![catalog](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b566b572-6575-4741-aeb1-dad76df3cd02)

Click on ASSIGN / CHANGE button on the right of the desired line 

In the dialog you can type in the search input, the Select Dso list will be filled with the corresponding values
![dialog box](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bccb4c1a-62ba-4da3-b082-a015bf7c6557)

Then if you want you can edit the description as you want. 

### Chapter 5: Features implemented but need more test

FTP Support:
Integration with FTP, allowing direct connection to the Dwarf for data retrieval and storage.

MTP Support:
Integration with MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) for Dwarf 2 to analyze the current Dwarf disk.

### Chapter 5: Upcoming Features

FITS Updates:
Enhancements and updates to better handle FITS files, including new features and improved processing.

Moving Files Between Backup / Object:
Feature to move files between different backups or object directories, enabling better organization.

Add Darks Backup and Association with Dwarf:
Support for managing Darks sessions, including adding and associating them with Dwarf sessions for processing.

Regroup Object Sessions for Mosaic:
The ability to group sessions based on objects, enabling easier management and creation of mosaics.
